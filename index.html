                <h3>Welcome to Growing Voices</h3>
                <p>The process of language and literacy entry among all children is individual. Language is at the core of identity, relationships and learning, since a baby makes his first babble until the time when he/she boasts about his/her first story. It is a site made by families seeking easy, no nonsense tips based on research to help their children achieve success with speaking, listening, reading, and writing.</p>

                <p>Language is not merely a matter of words. It is how children communicate and exchange ideas, and show their connectedness to the world. In the case of children who are raised in more than one language like in the household where they speak Hindi, and in society where they speak English, the language should be a source of pride since they are bilingual. The retention of home language and acquisition of the English language creates cultural identity and has been reported to help the children think and solve problems more flexibly as well as perform well in school.</p>

                <p>This location will show you the major milestones of early language and literacy development, why speaking and listening are so important, how reading and writing develop, and provide some easy tips on how to make your home language-rich environment. On its way, it gives explicit connections to the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), the National Quality Standard (NQS) and the Australian Curriculum.</p>

                    <h3>üåç Supporting Multilingual Children</h3>
                    <p>In the case of children who are not English speakers at home, the fact that they speak more than one language is an advantage, rather than a drawback. Preserving the home language not only offers strong cultural and family affiliations but it also facilitates learning English. The bilingual children usually demonstrate improved problem solving capabilities and ability to think and act flexibly, as well as good school performance later.</p>
