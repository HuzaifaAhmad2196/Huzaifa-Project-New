            At every stage of the early literacy development, it is evident to
            find connections with national structures and standards:
          </p>

          <p>
            The EYLF has identified communication as a core part in the learning
            and development of children (Outcome 5) and the significance of
            cultural identity and belonging (Outcome 1).
          </p>

          <p>
            The NQS emphasizes involvement of programs containing communication
            into play (QA1), responsive and respectful relationships (QA5), and
            partnership with families (QA6).
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the Australian Curriculum (English F2), phonics, oral
            language, reading, and writing are considered essential to future
            literacy achievement.
