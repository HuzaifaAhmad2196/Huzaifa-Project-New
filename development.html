                        Language development is a course, but the path of a particular child is his/her own. Cooing and babbling are the starting stages where the baby can use gestures and sounds to interact with the caregivers. At about 1 year they can frequently come up with the first recognisable words, normally names of people or common items. During the toddler age, vocabulary grows at a very fast rate and the two word phrases develop. At the age of three, children are expected to speak in sentences and also enjoy telling stories. Preschool age kids start playing with humour, rhymes and more sophisticated grammar and at the first school years, most children are able to narrate elaborate stories and engage in long conversations.

                        <strong>Important:</strong> These are not strict schedules; instead, they are guidelines to the types of skills that children normally acquire. The EYLF helps us to recall the fact that children learn differently and at various rates and that learning is a process that should be praised as progressive. Milestones are just useful pointers that families need to take into account but should not be in the form of a set of strict checklists, with families observing possible difficulties.

                                <strong>💡 How You Can Help:</strong> This process can be guided by families that are able to provide children with books, draw and write materials, as well as to associate verbal and written forms. Reading out loud every day, indicating words in stories and asking children to write down shopping lists or birthday cards, although they may use an invented spelling, makes them understand the relationship between spoken language and written language.

                        <h4>Multilingual Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            Children learning more than one language may have slightly different patterns of 
                            development, and this is completely normal and healthy. They might:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mix languages in the same sentence (called code-switching) - this is a sign of sophisticated language skills</li>
                            <li>Have a larger overall vocabulary across both languages than in just one language</li>
                            <li>Go through periods of preferring one language</li>
                            <li>Take a bit longer to start talking, but catch up quickly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Remember:</strong> Learning multiple languages is a gift! Keep using your 
                            home language - it supports all language development.

                        <h4>Individual Differences</h4>
                        <p>
                            Every child is unique! Some children are naturally more talkative, while others are 
                            more reserved. Some learn language in bursts, others steadily. What matters is:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your child is making progress over time</li>
                            <li>Your child is communicating effectively for their age (even if not perfectly)</li>
                            <li>Your child is engaged and interested in communication</li>
                            <li>You feel confident in your child's ability to express needs and connect with others</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Trust your instincts as a parent. Consider talking to a professional if:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your child isn't babbling or making sounds by 12 months</li>
                            <li>Your child isn't using words by 18 months</li>
                            <li>Your child isn't combining words by 2-2.5 years</li>
                            <li>Your child loses language skills they previously had</li>
                            <li>Your child's speech is very difficult to understand after age 3</li>
                            <li>Your child seems frustrated trying to communicate</li>
                            <li>You have concerns about your child's hearing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Early intervention works!</strong> If you have concerns, reach out to your 
                            doctor or a speech pathologist. There's no harm in asking questions.
