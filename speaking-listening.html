                    <p>Children start learning language through listening. They listen to voices, rhythms and sounds way before they utter their first words. When they listen, they are exposed to ideas and vocabulary whereas when they speak they are able to express themselves, ask questions and establish relationships. These are the skills that develop and support each other.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Early Language Development</h3>
                <p>During early childhood, children will play around with sounds and then they will start combining words into a short sentence. They can say doggy run to describe what they see and slowly take more and complex phrases. Listening is also equally important to assist children to concentrate on instructions, enjoy stories and follow their instructions. Speaking and listening are the basis of literacy, when children cannot maintain a good oral language, they can have a hard time once they start reading and writing.</p>

                    <h3>🌍 Supporting Multilingual Children</h3>
                    <p>For children learning multiple languages, speaking and listening skills develop across all languages. Families should use the language they are most comfortable with to provide authentic and rich communication experiences. The first language builds holistic development and supports English acquisition. Mixing languages is a natural stage of growth and should be celebrated as a sign of sophisticated language skills.</p>
